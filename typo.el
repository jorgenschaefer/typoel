;;; Commentary:

;; typo.el includes two modes, `typo-mode` and `typo-global-mode`.
;;
;; `typo-mode` is a buffer-specific minor mode that will change a number
;; of normal keys to make them insert typographically useful unicode
;; characters. Some of those keys can be used repeatedly to cycle through
;; variations. This includes in particular quotation marks and dashes.
;;
;; `typo-global-mode` introduces a global minor mode which adds the
;; `C-c 8` prefix to complement Emacs’ default `C-x 8` prefix map.
;;
;; See the documentation of `typo-mode` and `typo-global-mode` for
;; further details.
;;
;; ## Quotation Marks
;;
;; > “He said, ‘leave me alone,’ and closed the door.”
;;
;; All quotation marks in this sentence were added by hitting the " key
;; exactly once each. typo.el guessed the correct glyphs to use from
;; context. If it gets it wrong, you can just repeat hitting the " key
;; until you get the quotation mark you wanted.
;;
;; `M-x typo-change-language` lets you change which quotation marks to
;; use. This is also configurable, in case you want to add your own.
;;
;; ## Dashes and Dots
;;
;; The hyphen key will insert a default hyphen-minus glyph. On repeated
;; use, though, it will cycle through the en-dash, em-dash, and a number
;; of other dash-like glyphs available in Unicode. This means that typing
;; two dashes inserts an en-dash and typing three dashes inserts an
;; em-dash, as would be expected. The name of the currently inserted dash
;; is shown in the minibuffer.
;;
;; The full stop key will self-insert as usual. When three dots are
;; inserted in a row, though, they are replaced by a horizontal ellipsis
;; glyph.
;;
;; ## Other Keys
;;
;; Tick and backtick keys insert the appropriate quotation mark as well.
;; The less-than and greater-than signs cycle insert the default glyphs
;; on first use, but cycle through double and single guillemets on
;; repeated use.
;;
;; ## Prefix Map
;;
;; In addition to the above, typo-global-mode also provides a
;; globally-accessible key map under the `C-c 8` prefix (akin to Emacs’
;; default `C-x 8` prefix map) to insert various Unicode characters.
;;
;; In particular, `C-c 8 SPC` will insert a no-break space. Continued use
;; of SPC after this will cycle through half a dozen different space
;; types available in Unicode.
;;
;; Check the mode’s documentation for more details.

;;; Code:

;; For some reason, Emacs default has these as parentheses. This is
;; completely confusing when mixing this with normal parentheses,
;; and gets e.g. the following code wrong, even. Punctuation syntax
;; results in much more intuitive behavior.
(modify-syntax-entry ?» ".")
(modify-syntax-entry ?« ".")
;; Sorry for the intrusion.
